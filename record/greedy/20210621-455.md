455. Assign Cookies

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

#### 分析
这道题属于贪心问题，只要让孩子拿到尽量小且满足其需求的饼干即可。我的方法是先将饼干和孩子要的饼干进行排序，
然后使其尽可能拿小的即可，时间复杂度约等于排序的时间复杂度。(拿饼干时间不会超过饼干的个数)
